# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?

    - I feel pretty good with them after some trouble initially. Remembering that I was seeking a true return when doing some of the practices helped me recalibrate and look for some assistance online e.g. '!variable.include?'

2. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?

    -  This one came much easier. I have some experience with and/or logic which helped.

3. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?

    -  I feel pretty good here though I will need some more practice crafting inclusive 'else' statements. After accounting for conditions with 'elsif' I found myself wondering what to put for the 'else'

4.  How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

    - This one took longer than I had expected espeically given that we had gone over a lot of it in my small group. I expect the cold I am facing played some role in getting everything to gel correctly in my head. 

5. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

    - I definitely intend to do go through the assigment again just to make sure I recall everything. I am going to put a block of time on the calender tomorrow to do so. 

6. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

    - I was able to find solutions online to the questions I had while doing the assigment which felt great.
